<ul>
<li>In this stream, there is no such thing as a stupid question. I will gladly answer even the most basic questions, because that’s what this stream is, a stream for the very basics of getting into raids. You can send questions to me in whisper or in guild chat any time, but if you want to ask them to me verbally, I ask that you wait until I say I’m accepting questions, so that we don’t get too hung up on questions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="common-raid-misconceptions">Common Raid Misconceptions</h2>
<p>If you enjoy Guild Wars 2 combat, then you will enjoy raids. I have not met anybody who enjoys the game that, given a safe and friendly environment and the right opportunity, didn’t enjoy raids. But there are some common misconceptions that I’d like to clear up.</p>
<ul>
<li>First off, <strong>you have time to raid</strong>. Unless you literally play this game only 30 minutes a week, you will have enough time to play this game mode. Just take the time you need to prepare, however long that takes, and after that it’s simply a matter of being able to dedicate a long enough stretch of time to raid with a group, usually around 2-3 hours. In training guilds like RTI and Raid Academy, there is no expectation that you’re able to join raids on a regular basis. Just commit to raids you know you have the time for and you can do it at whatever pace you want.</li>
<li>Secondly, <strong>you’re not too squishy</strong>. Don’t try putting extra toughness on your gear just because you’re an elementalist and have a tiny health pool. It won’t help you in raids. There are people dedicated to healing you, buffing you with defensive boons like protection and aegis and resistance and stability, and ressing you if you go down. Taking 300 extra toughness will not help you survive in raids. Stacking properly with the group, knowing which attacks to dodge, knowing how to position, that’s what helps, and you know how to get that? Practice. That’s all it is. In fact, I’d urge you not to take toughness at all unless you know what you’re doing - the tank in raids who gets aggro on the boss is the person with the most toughness most of the time, so if you put on some knight’s trinkets to keep yourself alive as a squishy thief, you’ll find that to be counterproductive, because suddenly that toughness might be enough to make you the tank and you and your group will have a big problem.</li>
<li>Thirdly, <strong>don’t try build experimentation</strong>. I understand that a lot of people enjoy the process of theorycrafting their own builds and figuring out a playstyle that works for them, but here’s my advice: don’t do that when you’re new to raids. Follow what’s already established to be good, reliable builds - we’ll go over where to find them and how to prepare those builds later. This doesn’t mean raids don’t have space for experimentation, far from it. But the golden rule is always this: learn the rules first, and then break them. For all the flak ArenaNet get for their balance, one thing I will always praise them for is that there is space for every single class in raids. No matter what class you play, there is a build, and in the vast majority of the case there are actually many builds, that you can run in raids. You have dozens of builds to choose from, and one of them is bound to tickle your fancy.</li>
<li>Finally, I want to say a couple of words to people who have <strong>anxiety</strong>, which is one of the main reasons I see people say they don’t want to try raids, and in my opinion one of the most valid reasons. Some people will just feel like they aren’t good enough or that they’re not thick-skinned enough to handle toxicity, etc etc. To those people, I can only say that I get it and that you’re absolutely right to feel that way, because raiding is a different kind of beast from just running around in open world on your own where the only person you’re affecting when you make mistakes is yourself. I will say though that if you start with training guilds like RTI, Zexy, Crossroads, and so on for EU and Raid Academy for NA, you’ll have a much easier time. From my experience with many people that have admitted to me that they had raid anxiety before trying raids, they’ve all said that training guilds helped them overcome it and that they’re a lot more confident in raids now. Avoid pugs and hardcore static groups, at least for the start, and get into raids slowly at your own pace with training and casual guilds, and you’ll find that it isn’t as scary and intensive as people make it out to be.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preparing-your-build">Preparing Your Build</h2>
<p>So I’ll preface this by saying that raids are endgame content. I don’t recommend raids to people that are fresh out of the dodging tutorial in Queensdale. Give yourself time to experience the game, do your story, get some masteries, try dungeons, fractals, strikes, DRMs, and so on and so forth. Does this mean you need to have all your masteries done and full ascended gear and all dungeons complete and fractal level 100 to start raids? No. I can’t give a concrete value for when you’re “ready” for raids, but I would say that you should at least be used to the game’s movement, dodging, know what the different boons do, know how to play your class, have done some more casual group content, and so on first.</p>
<p>For a lot of you tuning into this stream though, I imagine that you’re already past the stage of learning how to play the game and feel ready for raids. So what next?</p>
<h3 id="masteries">Masteries</h3>
<p>Firstly, make sure your masteries are ready to go. In RTI, we have a command called <code>?raid-masteries</code> which you can type in the <code>#bot_spam</code> channel that gives you a nice spreadsheet telling you what masteries to go for. As a broad rule, you’ll want all of <strong>gliding</strong>, all of <strong>raids</strong> (you unlock this track after completing your first raid encounter, by the way), and at least the <strong>Raptor</strong>, <strong>Springer</strong>, and <strong>Jackal</strong> masteries fully done. For those who don’t know, you need both mastery points AND experience to level up your masteries, and it’s also all expansion-specific. If I want, say, raid masteries, that’s in the Heart of Thorns section, so I need to get Maguuma Mastery Insights in Heart of Thorns maps, I need to select these masteries, and then I need to grind experience for those masteries.</p>
<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
<p>This is an often overlooked aspect of preparation, but knowing what <strong>settings</strong> to turn on and off is sometimes a really big deal. Navigating into our settings menu, we have a lot of checkboxes in front of us. A lot of these are personal preference, but there are some things you definitely should take my advice on:</p>
<p><strong>General Settings</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Show Skill Recharge</code> -&gt; On.</li>
<li><code>Show Target Health Percent</code> -&gt; On.</li>
<li><code>Thick Party/Squad Health Bars</code> -&gt; On if you’re a healer.</li>
<li><code>Always Show Party/Squad Health Bars</code> -&gt; On if you’re a healer.</li>
<li><code>Ground Targeting</code> -&gt; Fast with Range Indicator.</li>
<li><code>Double-Tap to Evade</code> -&gt; Off.</li>
<li><code>Double-Click / Right-Click to Attack/Interact</code> -&gt; Off.</li>
<li><code>Autotargeting</code> -&gt; On if you keybind the toggle, off otherwise.</li>
<li><code>Promote Skill Target</code> -&gt; On.</li>
<li><code>Lock Ground Target at Maximum Skill Range</code> -&gt; On.</li>
<li><code>Snap Ground Target to Current Target</code> -&gt; Off.</li>
<li><code>Allow Skill Retargeting</code> -&gt; On.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Graphics Settings</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Shaders</code> -&gt; At least Medium.</li>
<li><code>Character Model Limit</code> -&gt; Highest.</li>
<li><code>Effect LOD</code> -&gt; On.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, make sure your keybinds are all set to comfortable keys (you can use key modifiers like Shift, Alt, and Ctrl!) and that you <strong>don’t skill-click</strong>!</p>
<h3 id="build-choice">Build Choice</h3>
<p>Now you need to decide what raid build you want to run. Your one-stop shop for anything related to raid builds right now is <a href="https://snowcrows.com/">Snow Crows</a>. Most people already have a good idea of what class they want to play in raids, so choose your class in the list under <code>Raid Builds</code>. Let’s say I’m a Mesmer, that’s the class my heart is set on, so I click on Mesmer and now I’m on the page with all the different kinds of builds I can take.</p>
<p>You should notice that there’s a distinction between power builds, condition builds, also whether or not the build gives boons, whether it heals, what special buffs it gives, and so on and so forth. To understand what all of that means, we should understand what a typical raid squad composition looks like in a raid.</p>
<p>So let’s take a squad. You have two subgroups, subgroup 1 and subgroup 2. Now the concern is that all ten players get all of the important offensive boons in the game: Might, Fury, Quickness, and Alacrity. Since there’s currently no super reliable way to give quickness to ten players on your own due to target caps, we have a <strong>quickness</strong> source in every subgroup. The quickness source can be either a boon Chrono or a boon Firebrand. Then we need an <strong>alacrity</strong> source - there is a reliable way to give alacrity to ten players and that’s using a Renegade, so we throw an alacrity Renegade in one of the subgroups. With quickness and alacrity covered, we need a <strong>might</strong> source. This is done for ten players using a Druid. In some cases we can also manage this with a Tempest, but Druid is really the most popular source of might for ten players. We also want a <strong>fury</strong> source, which comes from a lot of different sources, but the standard setup has a quickness Firebrand in one subgroup giving fury with axe and their Feel My Wrath elite and a Druid giving fury with their Warhorn skill 5 in the other subgroup. Finally, we want <strong>Warrior banners</strong> for all ten people, so the vast majority of groups will throw a banner Berserker in there so that they can buff the squad with their Banner of Strength and Banner of Discipline.</p>
<p>There are other ways to set up a squad for sure, like having two Chronos in either subgroup, each giving quickness and alacrity, or having a boon Thief and alacrity Renegade to cover all boons for certain bosses where a boon Thief works, and so on and so forth. The most important thing is that the four offensive boons I mentioned - quickness, alacrity, fury, and might - are covered for all ten people.</p>
<p><strong>Heals</strong> are an important consideration too. Most groups will run two healers, the first being almost always a Druid and the second being either the quickness Firebrand or the alacrity Renegade. Whether to go for a heal quickness Firebrand or a heal alacrity Renegade is down to preference. Here in RTI we run mostly heal alacrity Renegade, but pugs will most often look for a heal quickness Firebrand. There are pros and cons of each choice and it’s not really part of the scope of this guide to be talking about that. For your information, the stat of choice for healers is almost always going to be Harrier’s, and a nice thing you can do is go for ascended heavy armour, trinkets, and weapons with Harrier’s stats and then be able to share that gear both with your Firebrand and your Renegade to be able to play both builds.</p>
<p>Once the boons are covered, the remaining spots are where the DPS players go. DPS builds are a dime a dozen, and every class in the game has at least one decent option for DPS, and many have multiple options. An important consideration about DPS builds and certain support builds is whether they are <strong>power</strong>- or <strong>condition</strong>-based. As many of you will know, damage comes from two main sources in this game: power damage and condition damage. Generally a damage-oriented build you’ll prepare for raids will either be focused on power damage and have stats like Berserker, Assassin, Diviner, and so on, or it’ll be focused on condition damage and will have stats like Viper, Sinister, Grieving, and so on. This is a really important distinction to make, because for certain raid bosses, power damage is a lot more effective than condition damage, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Heading back to Snow Crows, we now have a better idea what this different builds are about. Power Boon Chronomancer is a source of quickness, and in fact it will tell you in the description that it gives quickness to its subgroup and is taken when there’s an alacrity Renegade in the squad, meaning the Chronomancer doesn’t need to cover alacrity themselves. If we instead click on Condition Mirage, it tells you here that it’s a DPS build that is focused on confusion and torment.</p>
<p>One more thing to note here is the <strong>viability</strong> section on the right. This part will tell you how well a build performs on each boss in the game based on the well-informed opinions of the people in Snow Crows at least. Often times you’ll find that, for DPS builds in particular, some bosses can be green and others can be orange or red. This is very often because of what we were talking about, where power DPS is good for certain bosses and condition DPS is good for other bosses. For example, if we head to the Ranger section, we’ll find that power Soulbeast is good for certain bosses but then bad for others, and if you swap to condi Soulbeast, you’ll find that it’s good at the bosses power’s bad at. If we check out heal Druid, we’ll see that it’s viable pretty much everywhere, because it is basically a cornerstone of the meta due to how good it is at so many different things, not just healing others.</p>
<p>For some classes, the viability doesn’t look too good. If we navigate to Necromancer, we’ll see that they’re in a pretty sorry state of affairs. That’s alright though - remember that these viability sections are catered towards top tier gameplay. Power Reaper and condition Scourge are actually both very good beginner-friendly builds for getting into raids as a DPS player, and outside of the really high-end raiding, you’ll find that what really matters isn’t what build you’re playing but how much you’ve practised and how well you can adapt to the fight. In my raid trainings I find it really common for Necromancers to be top or close to top DPS, for example.</p>
<p>Anyway, once you’ve decided what build to pick, it’s time to prepare that particular build.</p>
<h3 id="elite-specs">Elite Specs</h3>
<p>Make sure your <strong>elite spec</strong> is unlocked. This is pretty obvious to most people but I want to get it out of the way. If you’re playing power Holosmith, for example, then you want the Holosmith specialisation fully unlocked, and you get that by doing Hero Challenges in the world (especially in Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire maps since those give ten Hero Points each rather than one), and then spending those points on the specialisation.</p>
<h3 id="traits--utilities">Traits &amp; Utilities</h3>
<p>Back to Snow Crows, we can see that they actually tell you exactly what <strong>traits</strong> and <strong>utilities</strong> to take. There’s often a lot of room to change things up, and the better you know your class, the more you’ll be able to adapt to whatever situation you come across. For example, if you’re on a Renegade and you’re in a fight where the swiftness boon helps a lot, like Dhuum for example, but you’re not actually getting that much, you might know that you can take the trait Rapid Flow in the Invocation trait line at a very small loss to your damage output and have basically permanent swiftness on yourself. For the most part though, the recommended traits and utilities are recommended for a reason and will come into play when you start learning the skill rotation of your class and how to play it.</p>
<h3 id="gear">Gear</h3>
<p>This part is where your wallets start fearing for their lives. Good <strong>gear</strong> in this game is a lot less grindy to get than in other similar games, but we have to remember that in the end this is an MMORPG and it can be a bit of a time sink to get the gear you want. I will say that the universal advice for all new raiders is to focus on getting weapons and trinkets of ascended rarity, and then going for exotic armour for the time being. Exotic armour is often much easier to get than ascended armour and you’ll experience a very minor loss in performance by using exotic for the time being, whereas weapons and trinkets being ascended makes a big difference compared to exotic.</p>
<p>The most important thing is ALWAYS that you get the correct stat prefixes, so if you mouse over each item of gear, it has to match the same pattern of stats that are on Snow Crows. If Snow Crows tells you to get, say, a Berserker headpiece, that means that whatever headpiece you get, whether exotic or ascended, will need to have power as its main stat and precision and ferocity as its minor stats. Getting the correct runes and sigils is also very very important, and you really shouldn’t cheap out over here.</p>
<p>As for HOW to get the gear: the wiki is your best friend. If you just search for what you want on the wiki, chances are you’ll find a page telling you how to get it. You can get good gear from the trading post, fractals, raids, story, elite specialisation collections, world bosses, achievements, and - the most reliable way - crafting. I also need to give a big shoutout to the amazing <a href="http://tinyurl.com/gw2gearing">guide</a> on the wiki for gearing your character. It goes into a lot of detail and is really your best guide for preparing your character with the correct gear.</p>
<p>A couple specific tips about gearing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ascended trinkets</strong> with whatever stat you want are very easy to get from the Living Story Season 3 &amp; 4 episodes. If you don’t have these episodes unlocked, it’s a somewhat reasonable number of gems to unlock them on your account and get access to those maps. If you get something like Out of the Shadows and A Crack in the Ice alone from Season 3, that’s already enough to cover all ascended trinkets for you.</li>
<li>Learn to <strong>stat-swap</strong> your gear. You can do it with ascended armour and weapons easily using the Mystic Forge by simply combining the exotic insignia/inscription with the stats you want, 5 Globs of Ectoplasm, an Anthology of Heroes, and your ascended armour or weapon in the Mystic Forge for a cheap way to stat-swap any ascended gear. Just remember that you will lose whatever upgrades are in there if you do this though!</li>
<li>If you go for the very popular route of starting with exotic armour and then upgrading to ascended when you have the funds for it, then you can feel free to put superior runes into that armour, but remember that you will need some way to get those runes out of your armour when retiring it to replace with ascended. This is probably going to be done with a <strong>Black Lion Salvage Kit</strong>, and fun fact about those is that you are scientifically guaranteed to have one lying around somewhere that you’re not aware of, but how hard it is to find which inventory or bank tab it’s in scales up with how much you need it.</li>
<li><strong>Infusions</strong> are often listed as part of builds on Snow Crows, but take it from me: you don’t need them for raiding, especially if you’ve just started. They’re a very minor stat increase that’s really only relevant for super top tier raiders that have hundreds of hours of raiding and want to min-max their DPS to a ridiculous degree.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="food">Food</h3>
<p>Back to Snow Crows - their website also mentions what <strong>food</strong> and <strong>enhancement</strong> you need to take. This is usually a matter of buying it straight off the trading post or crafting it if you have the right professions. I will mention that in RTI we have our own storage of ascended food that we use in trainings quite often, and in pugs you might find some generous people that drop ascended food as well, but for the most part, always have the correct food for your build prepared. Enhancements will never be dropped by anyone too, so make sure you have that prepared as well.</p>
<h2 id="practising">Practising</h2>
<p>So, you have all the masteries you need, your settings are correct, you’ve drilled it into your head to stop skill-clicking, you’ve chosen your class and build, you have the elite spec trained, and you have the correct food, enhancement, gear, traits, and utility skills. Great. You’re still not ready to raid, but you are getting very close. Now you need to make sure that you can perform your build’s <strong>skill rotation</strong> at a decent level. A skill rotation is just a fancy way of saying what is the most optimal order of buttons to press on my class to contribute the most that I can contribute to the raid.</p>
<p>This part is important, because just jumping in with no idea what you’re doing will not do anyone any favours, and you’ll find yourself very overwhelmed. You should do this even for builds that don’t necessarily have a strict rotation, like healers, simply because knowing what each and every skill does and what sort of skills you should cast on autopilot will do a lot to help you be more prepared.</p>
<h3 id="snow-crows-benchmarks">Snow Crows Benchmarks</h3>
<p>What Snow Crows does is that on each and every build page, they link to a <strong>benchmark</strong> video showing you the optimal skill rotation. They will have spent hours grinding as high of a DPS number that they can, and then they record themselves doing it and post it for everyone to see. Not only are there videos like this, but there’s also a written rotation for those who prefer that. I always recommend watching the video as well, because sometimes the written rotation will leave out certain thing that are pretty important, but this is basically the rotation you will need to memorise.</p>
<p>First things first, we need to go to the golem area that they’re in. That’s the Special Forces Training Area and we visit that place by going to the Lion’s Arch Aerodrome, which is basically the raiding hub in the game.</p>
<h3 id="special-forces-training-area">Special Forces Training Area</h3>
<p>To enter this area, we need to first open up a squad. This is something anyone can do, even if you don’t have a commander tag. Just turn on Raid Mode and then you can enter. This cave over here allows you to spawn a golem with just the right attributes and set up your boons and buffs in just the right way to make it closely mimic what sort of environment you would get in a raid.</p>
<p>We can start by spawning the golem, which we do via the <code>Golem Spawner</code>. We’ll set the golem hitbox size to <code>Average</code>, unless told otherwise on Snow Crows, set the health to 4 million (which is standard), and then head into additional options to apply conditions. At this point, we want to start mimicking what we see in the benchmark video. The most important condition to apply is <strong>vulnerability</strong>, which should be at 25 always since that’s a 25% damage increase right off the bat. You’ll sometimes find that your DPS is a lot lower than it should be, then look at the golem and realise that you forgot to give it vulnerability.</p>
<p>It’s also a golden rule to mimic what they have in the video, because certain traits interact with conditions applied to your target. For example, Thieves will likely have a trait that allows them to deal more damage the more unique conditions there are on their foe. Since not all conditions are realistic to maintain permanently in a raid, you’ll want to go for the conditions that the person in the Snow Crows benchmark has to be more realistic about what conditions you’ll likely come across in the raid and also to be able to better compare how you’re doing with how the benchmarker is doing.</p>
<p>Once we’ve spawned our golem, we can start adjusting ourselves. Again, we mimic what we see in the video. For Daredevil, for example, we’re going to apply Alacrity, Vigor, Swiftness, Regeneration, Quickness, 25 Might, and Fury. We’ll also go to the profession-specific combat enhancements, which are all pretty much standard for every benchmarked build, and apply Frost Spirit, Sun Spirit, Banner of Strength, Banner of Discipline, and Empower Allies.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll consume our food and enhancement, which is probably not something we want to do while practising but definitely something we want to do when comparing how well we do with the benchmark DPS, and we’ll start practising.</p>
<h3 id="rotation-tips">Rotation Tips</h3>
<p>This part is probably tedious for a lot of people. Memorising a rotation and hitting a punching bag that doesn’t hit back isn’t necessarily fun, but I do encourage you all to put a decent bit of effort into it. You want to get to a stage where your skill rotation is pretty much muscle memory.</p>
<p>Some rotations are harder than others. With Daredevil, for example, you have a very simple rotation, but with something like Weaver or condi Holosmith, you’ll find that it can get a bit more complicated. At this point it’s always wise to understand what makes the rotation work rather than memorising each step in the rotation like a parrot. For example, for Daredevil, we know that the rotation works by keeping your endurance low because of multiple dodge-related traits we’re taking, spamming skill 2 since that’s your highest damage output, unloading as many skill 2s as you can when your Assassin’s Signet can be cast, and otherwise following a very simple loop while always standing behind or to the side of our target. So just like that, without trying to memorise a literal shopping list of skills, I’m able to do a pretty good job with this rotation.</p>
<p>A good number to aim for is around <strong>80% - 90%</strong> of the benchmark. Compare the benchmark’s final DPS number with the final number you get in the chat log when you kill the golem, and if it’s within that range and you feel confident with it, then you’re in a good spot. Remmeber that you can use your special action key, the <code>Mushroom King's Blessing</code>, to reset your skills every time you want to have another go at the golem.</p>
<p>Another thing to point out is how to pick up speed. You will start off very slowly as you learn the rotation, but as you get better, you will get faster at pressing the buttons, which is really the key to upping your DPS number. For this, it’s nice to know about an advanced concept called <strong>skill-queuing</strong>. Basically, if we cast skills in quick succession in this game, then what it often tries to do is queue them so that when the first skill we press finishes its animation, the second skill starts right afterwards.</p>
<p>This allows us to be a lot faster at pressing our skills, but another important to concept to understand is <strong>skill priority</strong>. Skill queuing works for a lot of skills in this game, but certain skills, especially defensive skills and heal skills, will often have higher priority than regular skills, such that if you try and press one of these skills while casting a lesser priority skill, then that first skill’s animation will get interrupted and won’t actually cast.</p>
<h2 id="final-preparation">Final Preparation</h2>
<h3 id="arcdps">ArcDPS</h3>
<p><strong>ArcDPS</strong> is a very common tool for raiding. I’m not going to go into a huge amount of detail on how it works because I have a <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ArcDPSLoggingGuide">guide</a> that covers it in some more detail, but basically ArcDPS will tell you how good your DPS and the DPS of your squad mates is in real-time. You can also configure it using <code>Alt+Shift+T</code> to save log files that you can upload to the site <a href="https://dps.report/">dps.report</a> and then get a better look at how the fight went, how your DPS was compared to everyone else, how good your boons were, and all sorts of other very useful things. You can install it through the links in the <code>#raid_resources</code> channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/rti">RTI’s Discord</a>.</p>
<h3 id="guides">Guides</h3>
<p>If you navigate to the <code>#boss_guides</code> and <code>#class_guides</code> channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/rti">RTI’s Discord</a> you’ll find a ton of guides and point-of-view videos giving you a whole bunch of information to prepare yourself for any given raid boss. It’s always a good idea to brush up on these before going into a raid for the first time, or even the first time on a new role, just to get an idea of what is expected of you. I’d also like to give a shoutout to Snow Crows’ guides on their website. They have a detailed boss-by-boss guide for so many of their builds, and it’s always a good idea to read through them. Some of the information might not be relevant to you and your squad since often times they write things that are relevant more for high-end groups or different strategies to what you might be running, but these guides are otherwise insanely good resources.</p>
<h2 id="getting-into-a-raid">Getting into a Raid</h2>
<p>If you’ve done everything we’ve covered so far, then congratulations. You’re now more prepared than the vast majority of people at your level. Now we can talk about actually getting into a raid.</p>
<h3 id="training-guilds">Training Guilds</h3>
<p>If you’re on EU, you want to join <a href="https://discord.gg/rti">RTI</a>. Here we have raid trainings open to everyone posted on a highly regular basis, and as long as you get your <code>Member</code> role via the <code>#join_us</code> channel, you can join any one of them. Refer to the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/rtiquickstart">RTI Quickstart Guide</a> for some step-by-step instructions on how to get started raiding with us. Make sure you put in a <strong>training request</strong> via the <code>#training_requests</code> channel to get given priority to join raids whose bosses you’ve never killed before.</p>
<p>If you’re on NA, then our recommendation is going to be <a href="https://discord.gg/gw2ra">Raid Academy</a>. Just go onto the server and follow the instructions they have listed there.</p>
<h3 id="pugging">Pugging</h3>
<p>Pugging is a mixed bag to say the least. While I maintain that toxicity is not nearly as prevalent as people make it out to be in pugs, it is there. You’ll also find it a very common occurrence that you’ll just spend ages waiting for groups to fill only to have two attempts on the boss and then people who feel entitled for a quick kill end up leaving.</p>
<p>That being said, it’s not all bad, and for a lot of people, pugging is their main source of raiding. A couple of tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pugs will often ask for this thing called <strong>KP</strong>, which stands for <strong>Kill Proof</strong>. Basically, every time you finish a boss, you will get anywhere between 1 and 5 Guild Hall decoration tokens. Don’t consume or delete these. Maybe 0.1% of the Guild Wars 2 raiding population uses them for Guild Halls - most use them for KP. The KP of end bosses like Sabetha, Matthias, Xera, Deimos, and especially Dhuum, Qadim, and Qadim the Peerless, are definitely the most valuable. When a group says something like Wing 5, 50KP, they probably expect you to show them 50 of Dhuum’s Tokens.</li>
<li>Sometimes, pugs will also ask for <strong>LI</strong> or <strong>LD</strong>. These stand for <strong>Legendary Insights</strong> or <strong>Legendary Divinations</strong> and you get one insight for each Heart of Thorns boss kill and one divination for each Path of Fire boss kill. These are used for legendary armour and trinkets, but of course they’re also used as proof of experience for pugs. If you spend your LI or LD on legendary gear, then usually pinging that legendary gear instead will suffice for pug groups looking for LI or LD.</li>
<li>When you join a raid squad via the LFG, first thing they’ll expect you to do is ping your KP, LI, or LD. You do this by <code>Ctrl+Left-Clicking</code> on whatever you want to ping around 3 or 4 times. Pinging it in quick succession like that will prove to them that you actually have the KP that you say you have rather than just forging a fake chatcode and pasting that into your chatbox, which is actually something that’s possible to do as well.</li>
<li>It’s very common to simply not meet the requirements of a given raid LFG. Instead of trying to sneak in there or fake chatcodes, my recommendation will be to actually be upfront to the commander. If you want to join a Dhuum group that’s asking for 20 KP but you only have 6 that you got from joining some trainings, then tell the commander that. More often than not, they’ll be okay with giving you a chance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="raid-statics">Raid Statics</h3>
<p>When you’ve gotten some experience with raids and want to do it on a regular basis, you might find the prospect of <strong>joining a static raiding group</strong> pretty attractive. This is definitely something you can do. There are groups out there that look for people to raid with them regularly every week. What you’ll often find is that they’ll trial you to see if you’re a good fit for the group and that your performance is at a level that they’re happy with.</p>
<p>You can find raid static groups on the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment">/r/guildrecruitment</a> subreddit and using the <code>#lf_static</code> and <code>#static_lfm</code> channels on <a href="https://discord.gg/rti">RTI’s Discord</a>.</p>
<h2 id="raiding">Raiding</h2>
<p>Once you’ve found a group and gotten into a raid with them, it’s time to start the actual process of raiding. This is where the fun begins. Now I can’t exactly give suitable raiding advice to you guys in this guide since it will vary a lot depending on your group, class, build, and boss, and if you’re in a training guild you will probably get class-specific and boss-specific advice from the commander, but I can give you a couple of tips. These tips are taken straight out of the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/rtiquickstart">RTI Quickstart Guide</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can repair your armour in raids at Ley Rifts with the mastery. If you don’t have this mastery, you can use the anvil present at the start of every raid wing.</li>
<li>If you get someone to open an instance at a particular boss for you, don’t “opener snipe”, which is loading into that instance until they’ve confirmed that they’re loaded in.</li>
<li>If you open a raid wing instance of a wing you haven’t completed all the bosses for that week, then it will open with your progress saved.</li>
<li><code>/gg</code> allows you to quickly suicide without damaging your armour. It’s used to reset a raid boss attempt to try again.</li>
<li>You can use <code>/gg</code> to teleport to the squad upon entering an instance.</li>
<li>If everyone dies while fighting a raid boss (even by using <code>/gg</code>), they respawn with their cooldowns reset.</li>
<li>If you miss a ready check and can’t ready up, press <code>P</code> or click the arrow at the top left of the squad UI and ready up from there.</li>
<li>Party chat (<code>/p</code>) is only visible to people in your squad subgroup. Squad chat (/d) is visible to everyone in the squad.</li>
<li>LFG squads often ask for things like “40KP” or “200LI”. They expect you to, upon entering, hold Ctrl and click spam 3-4 times on your KP or LI in your inventory to prove you have it.</li>
<li>Turn up effects volume - many attacks in raids have sound cues!</li>
<li>Stand tightly in the stack as often as possible. This is where all the boons and healing is!</li>
<li>There is a red bar indicator below your skills when you’re out of range of your target.</li>
<li>Know your CC skills and which CC of yours is more impactful. This Wiki page helps a lot with that!</li>
<li>On almost all bosses, standing behind the raid boss is recommended to avoid taking unnecessary damage that should only be designated for the tank.</li>
<li>You can prioritise whom to resurrect by clicking on their name in the squad UI before beginning to resurrect, which will target their downed bodies.</li>
<li>You can easily target the raid boss by clicking on their health bar in the raid event information UI at the top right.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="rewards">Rewards</h2>
<p>Every time you beat a boss, you’ll get a bunch of different rewards. Let’s start with the currency.</p>
<p><strong>Magnetite Shards</strong> are the currency you get from Heart of Thorns raids, whilst <strong>Gaeting Crystals</strong> are the currency you get from Path of Fire raids. You can spend them at the vendor in the Lion’s Arch Aerodrome or, for wing-specific rewards, spend them at Scholar Glenna’s vendor in the respective wing.</p>
<p>You’ll also get a guaranteed 2 gold for each boss kill which is 4 gold for bosses in the newest wing, currently wing 7, and in the wing designated as the <strong>Call of the Mists</strong> wing that week, which is the wing with a special icon above it in the Lion’s Arch Aerodrome.</p>
<p>You’ll get a guaranteed Exotic weapon or armour.</p>
<p>You’ll get anywhere from 1 to 5 (inclusive) KP, like we covered.</p>
<p>You’ll get raid-specific rewards, which include ascended weapon and armour drops with unique skins, minis (that you can exchange for currency if you drop duplicates or don’t care for them), and rarely you can even get high-value items like infusions that you can sell for hundreds of gold on the Trading Post.</p>
<p>And finally, you’ll get a <strong>Legendary Insight</strong> from Heart of Thorns raids, which are wings 1-4, and a <strong>Legendary Divination</strong> for Path of Fire raids, which are wings 5-7. These are what you’ll need for your full set of legendary armour or for your legendary ring, Coalescence.</p>
<p>Legendary armour is a pretty popular reason for people getting into raids so I’ll focus on that a little bit. The Legendary armour is called Envoy Armour, and you get the things required for it via two collections: <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Envoy_Armor_I:_Experimental_Armor">Envoy Armor I</a> and <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Envoy_Armor_II:_Refined_Armor">Envoy Armor II</a>. You can type <code>/wiki</code> followed by your search query in-game to go straight to the wiki page and take a look at what you need to finish these collections.</p>
<p>Most of them involve killing raid bosses, needless to say. When you complete the first collection, you will get a full set of fully stat-selectable ascended armour of whatever armour weight you choose. When you complete the second collection, you’ll get ANOTHER full set of stat-selectable armour, but this time, the weight you choose for this ascended armour will be the weight you’re stuck with for your legendary armour.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That covers pretty much everything I could think of that a raid beginner would like to know. If you still have any questions, you can always ask in the <code>#ask_questions</code> channel of <a href="https://discord.gg/rti">RTI’s Discord</a>. I hope I’ve encouraged you all to give raids a shot and that you’re a little less overwhelmed about the idea of getting into raids!</p>
